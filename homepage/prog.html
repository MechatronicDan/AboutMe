            <h4>Welcome to my programming page!</h4>
            <p>Programming has always been an interest of mine. In fact I have already completed the CS50w course and I am currently working on this CS50x course.
                The projects I have done vary from web development, game development, and microcontroller programming.
                I have also done some personal projects for example ultilizing the fitbit API to automatically log my sleep into notion.
                Which I had done manually prior to this. I am excited to learn more about programming and to continue to improve my skills in this field.
            </p>

                I would like to thank the team at CS50 for their excellent courses and resources, and most importantly for making this available to everyone.
