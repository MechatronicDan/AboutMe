            <h4>Welcome to my engineering page!</h4>
            <p>Engineering was a bit tougher to get into since you need physical components to work with.
                I have done some projects with microcontrollers such as arduinos which goes along with my programming skills.
                I also 3D printed some of my 3D art projects which is a great way to bring your digital creations to life.
                To improve my engineering skills, I have also done some CAD modelling using Solidworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to learn more about engineering and to continue to improve my skills in this field.
                This will mainly develop through my university course as I am studying Mechatronics.
                My end goal is to become a robotics engineer, to combine all of my skills and interests into one career,
                as robotics is a combination of programming, 3D design, and engineering.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                Not much to show here yet, but I look forward to creating more engineering projects in the future!
            </p>
